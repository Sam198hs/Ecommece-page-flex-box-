# Ecommece-page-flex-box-Problem
You need to create a responsive layout for a product listing page. The layout should contain:

A header with a logo on the left and navigation links on the right.
A main section that displays product cards in a grid format.
A footer with social media icons aligned to the center.
Requirements:
The header should use Flexbox to align the logo on the left and navigation links on the right.
The product cards should be displayed in a flexible grid layout. The grid should have 3 columns on larger screens (1200px and up) and 2 columns on medium screens (768px to 1199px). On smaller screens (below 768px), it should adjust to a single column.
The footer should center the social media icons horizontally.
The product cards should have the same height and width, and be evenly spaced in the grid. */
